# Dog Breed Classifier Project

This project is part of the **AI Programming with Python Nanodegree** by Udacity. The goal is to use pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as dogs or non-dogs, and for dog images, correctly identify their breeds.

## Main Objectives
1. Accurately identify which pet images are of dogs, even if the breed is misclassified.
2. Correctly classify the breed of the dogs in the images.
3. Evaluate which CNN architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG) best accomplishes the above objectives.
4. Consider the trade-off between accuracy and runtime, identifying if a faster alternative model might give an acceptable result.
