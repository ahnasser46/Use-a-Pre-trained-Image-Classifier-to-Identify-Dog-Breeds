Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Actually, I uploaded four images, not two. The models were able to correctly figure two out of them as dogs and classify their breed correctly. However, they weren't able to label the other two as dogs and their breed was also misclassified.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: They were able to classify the dogs and their flipped images to be the same breed.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, they did.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: In my point of view, they are alike because all models were able to spot non-dogs and classify them correctly, but all of them were able to label two out of four dogs' images and classify the unlabelled dogs incorrectly like bull mastiff instead of Kangal. So, further trials would be done to ensure which of them is better.
